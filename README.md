This repository demonstrates using a [kickstart](https://github.com/Keats/kickstart) template for a simple python project. It contains the following variables:

* `project_name`: the name of the project created by the template
* `target`: the target deployment of the project [`api` or `commandline`]
* `include_emoji`: whether or not to include emoji in the library output
